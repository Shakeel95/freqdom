My e-mail address (the maintainer) changed, after changing the institution.
Unfortunately, I don't have access to the EPFL account any more. 
Both emails start with "lukasz.kidzinski" which is quite unique in Functional
Data Analysis, yet I am happy to provide other proofs if necessary.

Regarding changes in the first resubmission of 2.0.1:
- I updated the title to capital letters
- I added more accurate description of the method and implementation

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.1
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a major refubrish of the package.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a major refubrish of the package, there is only one dependance:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pcdpca/index.html
which is managed by me and it is going to be updated promptly.
The updated version of pcdpca is already on CRAN
